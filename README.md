The project's goal is to build a cloud based system for location tracking;
including capturing sensitive transit data (eg: conditions of cargo), upload
this data to a proprietary cloud based API, and finally, make this data
easily accessible to the customer through a web application and data logging.

## client app

main point of interaction for users of the service.
